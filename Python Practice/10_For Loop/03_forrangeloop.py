# Use the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 19
# The range function takes two arguments: start and stop
# In this case, start is 1 and stop is 20, but the sequence will go up to 19 because the stop value is exclusive
for value in range(1, 20):
    # Print each value in the sequence
    print(value)
